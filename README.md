# WebGL Projects

This repository contains several WebGL projects that I created over a semester to help demonstrate and learn core concepts in computer graphics. These projects cover key topics such as:

- **Compiling Vertex and Fragment Shaders**
- **Animation in WebGL**
- **Interaction in WebGL**
- **Event-driven Programming**
- **Surface Approximation**
- **Geometry and Representation**
- **Transformations in WebGL**
- **Modeling in WebGL**
- **Hierarchical Modeling**
- **Viewing and Projection**
- **Lighting and Shading in WebGL**
- **Shading Examples**
- **Texture Mapping in WebGL**
- **Environment Mapping**
- **Bump Mapping**
- **RGBA Components**
- **Clipping Techniques**
- **Rasterization**
- **Hidden Surface Removal**
- **Curves and Surfaces**
- **Colors in WebGL**
- **Ray Tracing**

## How to Run the Projects

To run any of the projects, simply download the respective project folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. All projects are designed to be compatible with modern browsers and do not require any special permissions.

## Projects
